Function Expression is when a variable is declared with a value of a function.

  ex) let add = function ( num1, num2 ) {
                    return num1 + num2;
                    };
                    ^^ this semicolon is added for function expression.

Function Declaration is when function is declared. 

  ex) function add ( num1, num2 ) {
                    return num1 + num2;
                    }




In case of function declaration, even if the function is called before the function is declared, the function will still be called because it is "hoisted".
 
  ex) add(10,20) // return 30
      function add ( num1, num2 ) {
                    return num1 + num2;
                    }

However, in case of function expression, the function cannot be called before function expression

  ex) add(20,30) // Uncaught ReferenceError: add is not defined
      ex) let add = function ( num1, num2 ) {
                    return num1 + num2;
                    };

It is because of the way JS works. In JS, before executing a script, all function declarations are found and created. 

In other words, the functions are created in the initialization stage.
