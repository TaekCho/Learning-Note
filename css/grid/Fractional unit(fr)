fractional unit seems to be a very versatile tool to manage grid template.

It divides the remaining space by the number of fr units declared, so we don't have to waste time on specifying each and every size.

If you want to make a grid of 3 columns with the first column taking 200px and the other two taking 40% and 60% of the remaining spaces:

  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 2fr 3fr;
  }
