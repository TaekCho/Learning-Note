Flex boxes can be stretched or shrunk by using `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`.
Both `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` has to be set for children flex boxes, not the container.

The `flex-grow`, when it is set true(flex-grow: 1;), will fill up the remaining space by stretching each element wide enough to fill up the remaining space.
This attribute must be applied to the child element of the flex-container.

The `flex-shrink`, when it is set true(flex-shirnk: 1;), will shrink until the box is set at the shortest possible length(depending on the size of the content, or the longest letter in a sentence).
BUT, it doesn't shrink when the flex-container has a `flex-wrap` attribute set as `wrap`, as overflowing boxes will be wrapped around, moving overflowing boxes to the next lines.


When they grow and shrink, the size of each flex box won't be the same because,
  the default value of flex-basis is auto(flex-basis: auto;), so the box size depends on the size of the content in the box.

  To prevent that, we can set the flex-basis as 0(flex-basis: 0;),
    which will make all the sizes equal to one another.



Shorthand for all those `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`, respectively, will be as follow:

  flex: 1 1 0;
      ( ^ flex-grow: 1;,
          ^flex-shrink: 1;,
            ^flex-basis: 0; )
