There are some attributes to be set at the child level of a flex box, and it includes 'order'.

The `order` attribute works like an index, so when the order of elemeents is set as following:
  
  .last-element {
    order:2000
  }
  .element-a {
    order: 500
  }
  .element-b {
    order: 643
  }

  it would still align the properties in the order of element-a, element-b, last-element, according to the 'order' number assigned to each.
