Flex-basis: it decides the size of main-axis, so x-axis in case of 'flex-direction: row' OR the size of y-axis in case of 'flex-direction: column'.

HOWEVER, it is IMPORTANT that flex-basis is set in the child flex elements of the flex container.
  ex) .container {
        display: flex;
        gap: 1 rem;
        flex-direction: column;
      }
      .flex-element {
        /* this will set the size of y-axis, or height, in this case */
        flex-basis: 100px;
      }
