Types of font sizes:

  1. 1 px = 1/96 inch
  2. 1 pt = 1/72 inch
  3. 1 em = 100% of parent element
  4. 1 rem = 100% of root

font-weight:

  Font weight can be relatively set using "lighter" or "bolder" which set the font size bigger than the parent element by 100.


The difference between the sans-serif & serif:

  1. Sans-serif looks simpler as it does not have pointy corners.
  2. Serif looks formal. Times New Roman is a good example of serif fonts.


When the name of a font has spaces in-between:

  in such a case, we wrap it with `"` like a string.
    ex) h1 {
          font-family: "Times New Korean", serif
        }

    otherwise,

        h2 {
          font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif
        }
